# Test Schemas

This directory contains comprehensive GraphQL schemas used for testing and demonstrating the capabilities of the `graphql-docs-generator`. These schemas are fully fleshed out with:

- **Complex Types**: Interfaces, Unions, Enums, and custom Scalars.
- **Directives**: Extensive use of `@docGroup`, `@docPriority`, and `@docTags` for organization.
- **Metadata**: Associated JSON files for rich examples and error definitions.

## Available Schemas

- **[ecommerce](./ecommerce)**: A comprehensive e-commerce platform schema covering users, products, orders, and reviews.
- **[library](./library)**: A library management system schema demonstrating relationships between books, authors, and loans.
